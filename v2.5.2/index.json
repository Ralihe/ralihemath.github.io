We use a database of 188 municipalities where 71 per cent of the national population is concentrated, according to 2016 estimates. In this paper, we calculate, describe and geo-reference a 2016 e-value index to evaluate the supply of digital services in each one of the municipalities. The predictors of the index are analysed using Ordinary Least Squares models. The factors analysed are related to the dimensions distinguished by theory as necessary for the implementation of strategies of electronic government. The highlight findings reveal recognisable spatial distribution patterns in the Metropolitan region and enable us to identify the importance of the infrastructure, the political capital of the mayor and the financial independence of the municipality as significant determinants for successful development of electronic government initiatives at a municipal level.","tags":null,"title":"Determinantes del gobierno electrónico en las municipalidades: Evidencia del caso chileno","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Antoine Maillet","Bastián González-Bustamante","Alejandro Olivares L."],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1567641600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1567641600,"objectID":"248bc0b00b9edc94825b75879ece1419","permalink":"/~shil5311/publication/revolving-door-in-the-chilean-executive-branch/","publishdate":"2019-12-15T17:50:39Z","relpermalink":"/~shil5311/publication/revolving-door-in-the-chilean-executive-branch/","section":"publication","summary":"In the context of the global debate about the revolving door between private and public sectors, the case of Chile, a country in which the State has been considerably weakened, is of great interest. First, we describe the career paths of a universe of 386 individuals who held the posts of the minister, undersecretary (vice-minister) and superintendent between 2000 and 2014. Then, we examine the determinants of circulation between the public and private spheres using mixed-effects logistic regression and a maximum likelihood logit model. Sex, professions of economist or lawyer, and private sector provenance are significant variables that increase the probabilities of transition from the private to the public sphere and subsequent return to the private world. The fact of being a political party member is significant but lessens the probability of circulation. This effect is different depending on the government and the type of position.","tags":null,"title":"Public-Private Circulation and the Revolving Door in the Chilean Executive Branch (2000–2014)","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Bastián González-Bustamante","Matías Astete","Berenice Orvenes"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1548547200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1548547200,"objectID":"4c6207b33ef8ea3009afa5e6c10d1ed1","permalink":"/~shil5311/project/survival-of-the-senior-civil-servants-in-the-chilean-executive-branch/","publishdate":"2019-01-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/~shil5311/project/survival-of-the-senior-civil-servants-in-the-chilean-executive-branch/","section":"project","summary":"","tags":["Ongoing Projects"],"title":"Survival of the Senior Civil Servants in the Chilean Executive Branch","type":"project"},{"authors":["Bastián González-Bustamante"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1548547200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1548547200,"objectID":"1ee315f391242dac086fcaac1895d419","permalink":"/~shil5311/project/the-chilean-executive-during-the-democratic-post-transition/","publishdate":"2019-01-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/~shil5311/project/the-chilean-executive-during-the-democratic-post-transition/","section":"project","summary":"","tags":["Finished Projects"],"title":"The Chilean Executive During the Democratic Post-Transition","type":"project"},{"authors":["Bastián González-Bustamante"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1548028800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1548028800,"objectID":"5d8aad0267c783726f2dbb93469d78ef","permalink":"/~shil5311/publication/brechas-representacion-y-congruencia-elite-ciudadania-en-chile-y-uruguay/","publishdate":"2019-12-15T18:16:02Z","relpermalink":"/~shil5311/publication/brechas-representacion-y-congruencia-elite-ciudadania-en-chile-y-uruguay/","section":"publication","summary":"This paper analyses three dimensions of elite-mass congruence in Chile and  Uruguay:  (a)  ideological;  (b)  public issues,  support, and satisfaction with democracy; and, (c) economic preferences on the role of the State. Data from probabilistic national surveys and surveys on elites financed by IDRC-Canada and carried out from  2013  to  2014  in each country are used.  Congruence indexes are calculated to identify gaps between citizens and representatives. The main indexes used are Relative Citizen Congruence and Earth Mover’s Distance, a recent innovation borrowed from computer science. The findings show a greater ideological congruence in Chile, a greater congruence on support to democracy in  Uruguay, and important gaps on education issues in  Chile.  Furthermore,  in both countries, there is greater congruence regarding relevant public issues between higher socioeconomic level population and the political elite.","tags":null,"title":"Brechas, representación y congruencia élite-ciudadanía en Chile y Uruguay","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Luis Garrido-Vergara","Bastián González-Bustamante"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1547942400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1547942400,"objectID":"c8729a1ccf4b7324125b0855dc31e6ab","permalink":"/~shil5311/project/public-opinion-and-stateness/","publishdate":"2019-01-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/~shil5311/project/public-opinion-and-stateness/","section":"project","summary":"","tags":["Stand-By Projects"],"title":"Public Opinion and Stateness: Evidence from the Chilean Case","type":"project"},{"authors":["Diego Barría","Bastián González-Bustamante","Carla Cisternas"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"91668aae2f37b47b3e390e9140400f32","permalink":"/~shil5311/publication/la-literatura-sobre-gobierno-abierto-en-espanol/","publishdate":"2019-12-15T18:39:21Z","relpermalink":"/~shil5311/publication/la-literatura-sobre-gobierno-abierto-en-espanol/","section":"publication","summary":"Open government has become one of the concepts that most recently attracted professionals and academics dedicated to public administration. Likewise, it is possible to notice the appearance of a growing volume of academic works dedicated to analysing the concept and experiences of open government in the region. This paper analyses the academic production in Spanish on open government. For this, texts published in specialised journals between 2009 and 2015 are identified. It characterises the main publication channels, indexing levels of journals that publish articles of the topic as well as bibliographic references.

Based on a universe of 386 individuals that were ministers, undersecretaries, and superintendents during the governments of Ricardo Lagos, Michelle Bachelet, and Sebastián Piñera, the political-professional trajectories with focus on the transition between private and public sectors are analysed. Two types of paths are examined: private-public circulation in general terms, as well as the movements inside the same economic area, which is defined as the revolving door. Generally speaking, sex, being an economist or lawyer and especially a trajectory linked to the private sector are statistically significant variable with positive coefficients to explain the public-private circulation. On the other hand, it is relevant but decreases the likelihood of circulation, the partisanship. This effect is different according to the government and the position.","tags":null,"title":"¿Puerta giratoria?

The results show that the political agendas of the alternative media are less diverse than in the case of the written digital media.

It is discovered that most messages were not favourable to the candidate, and it is detected a cluster of users that express messages against her.","tags":null,"title":"Evaluando Twitter como indicador de opinión pública: Una mirada al arribo de Bachelet a la presidencial chilena 2013","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Bastián González-Bustamante"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1419984000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1419984000,"objectID":"14a8e2ee524e6a1800a1a50480d7671a","permalink":"/~shil5311/publication/eleccion-directa-de-consejeros-regionales/","publishdate":"2019-12-15T22:15:12Z","relpermalink":"/~shil5311/publication/eleccion-directa-de-consejeros-regionales/","section":"publication","summary":"This article analyses the first popular election of regional councillors in Chile, a post which, before 2013, was chosen by local government representatives. The database used contains electoral and biographical information for each candidate (N = 1,382), which is compared to similar data for candidates in all Chilean elections between 1989-2013 (N = 50,462). This paper analyses electoral results and the factors that determine the election as a regional council member, using the concept of species of capital used in political sociology. It presents a descriptive analysis and maximum likelihood logit model. It finds that political and economic capitals are relevant factors for electoral success.","tags":null,"title":"Elección directa de consejeros regionales 2013.

We work with a database of 102 cases corresponding to 90 people who were appointed ministers in the mentioned period. We present a description of the group and a Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA). The results find that think tank membership is a relevant factor for appointments in political and economic ministries during both governments.","tags":null,"title":"Los think tanks en el gabinete: una exploración del caso chileno (2006-2014)","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Bastián González-Bustamante"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1412812800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1412812800,"objectID":"e17dc382bedb45e140f23fb2a0c27104","permalink":"/~shil5311/publication/nuevos-medios-y-politica-digital-el-caso-de-las-primarias-presidenciales-chilenas/","publishdate":"2019-12-16T12:28:51Z","relpermalink":"/~shil5311/publication/nuevos-medios-y-politica-digital-el-caso-de-las-primarias-presidenciales-chilenas/","section":"publication","summary":"This chapter explores the use of Twitter in digital campaigns.

Despite this, the study of the Chilean elites was somewhat stagnant in past decades; however, that situation is changing. This paper presents a synthesis of research, which is central to understand the sociology of the Chilean elites over the last twenty years. Additionally, it highlights the theoretical understandings that have occurred and offers perspectives for further research in the area, which match with the uninterrupted government of a centre-left coalition (la Concertación de Partidos por la Democracia). Additionally, the paper highlights the theoretical understandings that have occurred, offering perspectives for further research in the area, which are related to the study of social networks and partisan environment, also suggests promoting studies which linking political and economic elites with cultural (epistemic communities). The synthesis of research shows the existence of a local and solid theory; it shows how the different research agree on the importance of technocratic phenomenon for the Chilean case, and also indicate the existence of an important core of technopols and a transversal party which shows the strength of the ties inside the Concertacion.","tags":null,"title":"El estudio de las élites en Chile: Aproximaciones conceptuales y metodológicas","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Bastián González-Bustamante"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1376006400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1376006400,"objectID":"558a795c8aabdc11a8dcf53c9c5e0869","permalink":"/~shil5311/publication/factores-de-acceso-y-permanencia-de-la-elite-politica-gubernamental-en-chile/","publishdate":"2019-12-15T22:37:11Z","relpermalink":"/~shil5311/publication/factores-de-acceso-y-permanencia-de-la-elite-politica-gubernamental-en-chile/","section":"publication","summary":"This article analyses the factors affecting access and permanence of the governmental political elite in Chile from 1990 to 2010, utilising data from a survey of 386 members of the elite who entered the political field. Only 199 cases from the survey qualify as part of the governmental elite. It presents a description of the group, a relevant permanence index, and a logistic binary regression model together with a  Qualitative  Comparative  Analysis  (QCA).  The results find a homogeneous group, and that the factors affecting access are not the same as those for permanence. It concludes that, although a technical profile facilitates access, political capital and previous participation in think tanks are more relevant for permanence in the highest political positions.","tags":null,"title":"Factores de acceso y permanencia de la élite política gubernamental en Chile (1990-2010)","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Bastián González-Bustamante","Gabriel Henríquez"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1357084800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1357084800,"objectID":"c693ae9ebeb482d9622e0ed95fb4fa3a","permalink":"/~shil5311/publication/chile-la-campana-digital/","publishdate":"2019-12-16T12:37:07Z","relpermalink":"/~shil5311/publication/chile-la-campana-digital/","section":"publication","summary":"This chapter is based on the Chilean case, which is relevant because of two significant elements. First, it is possible to identify the adoption of e-democracy tools, as well as a conflict between traditional electoral managers and new ones that disagree about the adoption of digital media. Second, the use of digital strategies is adopted in a context of low electoral turnout levels and allows the inclusion of the youngest population sector to the electoral campaign.","tags":null,"title":"Chile: la campaña digital 2009-2010","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Bastián González-Bustamante","Gabriel Henríquez"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1345507200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1345507200,"objectID":"8cc57a60d24fabb72525051b71318a94","permalink":"/~shil5311/publication/campanas-digitales-branding-o-participacion-politica/","publishdate":"2019-12-15T22:46:29Z","relpermalink":"/~shil5311/publication/campanas-digitales-branding-o-participacion-politica/","section":"publication","summary":"Although television has been traditionally the main channel of mass communication between candidates and electors, social media has emerged as a new channel, becoming a relevant platform where a dynamic flux of information is shared by electors and candidates. The role of social media can be considered from a classical perspective, in other words, as a tool or asset to be managed. Or, it can also be viewed as a new dimension of development that encourages political participation. Considering the Barack Obama’s 2007-2008 presidential campaign established an opening point in the use of new technologies of information and Internet in electoral campaigning throughout the world, the main objective of our work is to evaluate the role of social media in the last Chilean presidential campaign.","tags":null,"title":"Campañas digitales: ¿Branding o participación política?","type":"publication"}]
