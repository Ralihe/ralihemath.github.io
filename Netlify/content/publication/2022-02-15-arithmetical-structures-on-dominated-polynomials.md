abstract: 'In~\cite{algorithmic} was given an algorithm that computes arithmetical structures on matrices. We use some of the ideas contained there to get an algorithm that computes arithmetical structures over dominated polynomials. A dominated polynomial is an integer multivariate polynomial such that contains a monomial which is divided by all its monomials.'
