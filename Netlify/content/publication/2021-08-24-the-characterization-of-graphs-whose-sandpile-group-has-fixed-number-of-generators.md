abstract: 'Let K_k be the family of connected graphs G whose sandpile groups have minimal number of generators equal to |G|−k−1, where |G| is the number of vertices of G. We survey previous result on the characterization of K_1 and K_2, including complete characterizations for both cases. Furthermore, we shed some light on the characterization of K_3. Particularly, we give a minimal list of graphs that are forbidden for the regular graphs in K_3 and we use them to give a characterization of the regular graphs in K_3.'
