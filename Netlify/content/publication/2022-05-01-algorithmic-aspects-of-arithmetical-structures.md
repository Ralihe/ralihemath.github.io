abstract: 'Arithmetical structures on graphs were first introduced in [11]. Later in [3] they were
further studied in the setting of square non-negative integer matrices. In both cases, necessary and
sufficient conditions for the finiteness of the set of arithmetical structures were given.
More precisely, an arithmetical structure on a non-negative integer matrix L with zero diagonal is
a pair (d, r) ∈ N
n
+ × N
n
+ such that
(Diag(d) − L)r
t = 0
t
and gcd(r1, . . . , rn) = 1.
Thus, arithmetical structures on L are solutions of the polynomial Diophantine equation
fL(X) := det(Diag(X) − L) = 0.
Therefore, it is of interest to ask for an algorithm that compute them.
We present an algorithm that computes arithmetical structures on a square integer non-negative
matrix L with zero diagonal. In order to do this we introduce a new class of Z-matrices, which we
call quasi M-matrices.'
