abstract: 'In the last thirty years, the field of public administration in Latin America has turned around how to introduce public sector reforms inspired by the New Public Management. In fact, most public administrations have focused almost exclusively on introducing such types of reforms, ignoring a number of alternative approaches which have emerged in the academic debate. One of those alternatives is the public service motivation approach, which analyzes how certain intrinsic factors, directly associated with the very notion of public service, motivate public employees´ behavior. This article aims to foster a Latin American debate on designing and implementing human resources policies based on public service motivation theory. Based on a survey with a non-probabilistic sample of 172 respondents, the article identifies a number of public service motivation factors among Chilean public employees. The findings show that attraction to public policies, commitment to the general interest, and compassion are factors as powerful as love to money. At the same time, the results show that self-sacrifice does not motivate Chilean public employees. Based on these findings, a discussion on how public service motivation can be a useful framework to redesign human resources policies is provided.'
