abstract: 'If the Laplacian matrix of a graph has a full set of orthogonal eigenvectors with
entries Â±1, then the matrix formed by taking the columns as the eigenvectors is a
Hadamard matrix and the graph is said to be Hadamard diagonalizable.
In this article, we prove that if n = 8k+4 the only possible Hadamard diagonalizable
graphs are Kn, Kn/2,n/2
, 2Kn/2
, and nK1, and we develop an efficient computation for
determining all graphs diagonalized by a given Hadamard matrix of any order. Using
these two tools, we determine and present all Hadamard diagonalizable graphs up to
order 36. Note that it is not even known how many Hadamard matrices there are of
order 36.'
