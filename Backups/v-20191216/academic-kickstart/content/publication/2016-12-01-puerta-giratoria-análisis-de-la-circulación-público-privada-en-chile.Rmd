abstract: 'This document presents a first empirical approach to the public-private circulation in Chile, demonstrating its existence and drawing a preliminary analysis of its determinants. Based on a universe of 386 individuals that were ministers, undersecretaries, and superintendents during the governments of Ricardo Lagos, Michelle Bachelet, and Sebastián Piñera, the political-professional trajectories with focus on the transition between private and public sectors are analysed. Two types of paths are examined: private-public circulation in general terms, as well as the movements inside the same economic area, which is defined as the revolving door. Generally speaking, sex, being an economist or lawyer and especially a trajectory linked to the private sector are statistically significant variable with positive coefficients to explain the public-private circulation. On the other hand, it is relevant but decreases the likelihood of circulation, the partisanship. This effect is different according to the government and the position.'
