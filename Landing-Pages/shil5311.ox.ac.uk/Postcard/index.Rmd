I am a PRS in the DPhil (PhD) in Politics programme in the [Department of Politics and International Relations](https://www.politics.ox.ac.uk/) and [St Hilda’s College](https://www.sthildas.ox.ac.uk/) at the [University of Oxford](http://www.ox.ac.uk/), United Kingdom. Furthermore, I am an Instructor in the Department of Public Administration and Policy at the [Faculty of Economics and Management](https://fae.usach.cl/) at the Universidad de Santiago, where I have been working since 2014. 
 
Before starting the DPhil, I earned a BA (2:1) in Government and an MA (1st) in Political Science, both from the Universidad de Chile. Moreover, I worked as a lecturer at the Universidad de Santiago and the Universidad de Chile, as well as a consultant for the United Nations Development Programme.
 
My doctoral research is supervised by [Professor Petra Schleiter](https://www.politics.ox.ac.uk/academic-faculty/petra-schleiter.html) at St Hilda’s College and focuses on the stability of cabinets in Latin American presidential democracies. My research is supported by the Chilean National Agency for Research and Development.
